# Image Quality Enhancement for Low-Light Images

## Overview

This project focuses on improving the image quality of low-light images using a deep learning-based approach. The implemented solution involves the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to enhance the details and visual appeal of images captured in challenging lighting conditions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Keras

## Usage

**Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anandr07/Improving-Quality-of-Low-Light-Images
    ```

## Model Architecture

The image enhancement model is based on a custom-designed convolutional neural network. The architecture includes multiple convolutional layers, skip connections, and final convolutional layers to produce the enhanced image.

## Example Output

The final section of the script visualizes the results by displaying the ground truth, low-light image, and the enhanced image side by side.
